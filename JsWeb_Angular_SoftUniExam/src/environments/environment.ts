// Since this is a SoftUni exam project, I include the Firebase 
// configuration with API keys in the repository. Here's why:

// From the exam requirements:
// This is an exam project, not a production application
// Alternative approaches like using environment variables or separate config 
// files would make the examination take longer

// Make it harder for the examiner to test your project
// Take up valuable presentation time with setup
// Risk technical issues during defense
// So for this specific academic context, I am keep the firebase.config.ts 
// file with API keys in my repository. After your exam is complete,
// I will delete the Firebase project.
